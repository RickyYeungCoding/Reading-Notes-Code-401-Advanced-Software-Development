# Measuring Emotional Intelligence
I scored over 20 on each section, but there are still some things I can improve on. For example, I only scored a 3/5 on this statement "In assessing a situation, I look at my biases and adjust my
assessment accordingly". Sometimes I fail to recognize my biases and tend to fall victim to it. In the future, I also always thinks things through more logically rather than emotionally when addressing an issue. If i dont correct this issue, I will fall victim to a fixed mindset which will prevent me from expanding my knowledge and intelligence due to my biases.
