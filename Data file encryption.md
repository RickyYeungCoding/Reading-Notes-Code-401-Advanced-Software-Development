# You have been made responsible for the company’s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
If i was responsible for the company’s file server I would preserve the 3 elements of the CIA triad by first encrypt the data at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality. Next I would achieve data integrity by using hash functions and digital signatures. Lastly, I would ensure file transfer service availability by setting up a high availability cluster
# Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.
Hashing verifies data integrity because it creates a unique string of characters when data is sent from one location to another and can be checked if it matches the original string after the data transit allowing comparison to detect any changes or tampering with the original information.

# How is hashing and encryption different?
Once data is hashed, it cannot be reversed back to its original form while encryption is a reversible and mixes data using a key, making it unreadable to unauthorized users
