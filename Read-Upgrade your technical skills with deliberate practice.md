# Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice
Upgrading your Technical Skills is a very important for my career because it allows you to do more things in a computer from troubleshooting to implementing new tools and strategies.


# How much of the software you build really pushes you outside your comfort zone?

For example when coding a script, you have be accurate on almost every little detail, this leaves less room for error and ensures you figure out the solution from researching or from reviewing lectures which pushes you outside your comfort zone.


# How much of it is the same thing you were building last year with different names?

During our Ops 301 project week, it was a pretty similar situation we were put in as our Ops 201 project in which we were given a fictitious company and we needed to come up with solutions that include new softwares and hardwares and would be considered deliberate practice

# When's the last time you had to really dig deep to solve a technical problem?

I would say in our 301 group project, I had to figure out everything about a file server and how it could be successfully implemented into our network system for data backup

# We're all self-taught in this business. The only person who understands your skillset well enough to teach you is you. What challenges can you set yourself that meet these criteria?

I can set certain standards and timelimits on how long it takes for my complete a task, which applies pressure to me and challenges myself.


# What do you want to learn next? What have you thought would be cool to learn but were secretly afraid to try? 

I would like to learn more about ethical hacking, I find myself curious on that topic because I would like to know how to prevent threats. I thought vulnerability testing would be a cool things to learn but I do not want to mess up my personal computer.
