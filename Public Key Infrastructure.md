# Name the three main components which make up PKI.
The three components that make up PKI is registration authority, certificate authority, and certificate repository.
# How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.
The PKI is like a secret code vertification system for the internet. When visiting a website, your browser gets a ID that contains code and that code is checked by your browser to make sure it's the correct identity. After verification, your browser and the website can communicate using encryption.
# What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?
I would say the 3 weakness of PKI architecture is being able to trust the certificate authority to be the correct person that is assigned to be using it, being able to securely manage private keys so that no one can access them, and intelligence agencies can use fraudulent certificates for espionage.
