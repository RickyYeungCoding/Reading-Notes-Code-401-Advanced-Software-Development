# How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?
If your company complies with SOC2 compliance principles, it provides your business with a competitive advantage over other companies because SOC2 is a framework designed to ensure that a company's systems are secure, available, process data with integrity, and maintains the privacy of customer data.
# What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?
The 5 trust principles in SOC2 are security, confidentiality, availability, integrity, and privacy.
# How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
I would compare the 3 levels in the SOC2 to a baking a cake. The first layer is policies that employees follow which can be visualized as ingredients for the perfect recipe. The second layer is procedures which demonstrate how your policies work operationally like the steps you take while baking a cake using the ingredients. The third layer is proof which demonstrates adherence to polices and procedures, this is the finished cake itself, the result of following the recipe and procedures correctly.
