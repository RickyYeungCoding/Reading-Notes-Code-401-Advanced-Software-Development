# The Command Line

A Command line or terminal is basically a a text based interface to the system and you are able to execute commands by entering them, then a feedback will be shown. Within a terminal there is a shell which configures how the terminal will act and look after executing a command.

# Basic Navigation

In this section, it talks about remembering certain commands to execute to navigate through a terminal. It also mentions that when you refer to either a file or directory on the command line, its actually referring to a path. The two paths are Absolute path and Relative path. Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root directory while Relative path specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system

# More About Files

In Linux everything is considered a file whether its a text file or directory. Everything is Linux is also case sensitive so a File.txt would be different from a file.txt. Also Files or directories starting with at (.) are considered hidden in Linux and is often used for configuration files.

#Manual Pages

Manual pages are documentation for every command on the Linux system. They explain the function of each command, how its used, and what options it accepts. The manual page consists of the name and description of the command and synopsis.

# File Manipulation

In this article, it talks about creating a directory directory structure that will help organize data in a manageable way which improves speed and efficiency. It also mentions that you should copy your file before editing them incase you want to revert back to the original state which is command cp.

# Cheat Sheet

This article provides a list of commands that are commonly used to navigate the terminal. For example some important commands you would likely use is cd, pwd, ~, and .. It also mentions some commands that weâ€™ve rarely used like fg <job number>  which moves the given process from the background to the foreground.


# Observations

Aftering going through the Bash Command Line Tutorials it helped refresh my mind and I also gained more knowledge on how to navigate using commands Ive never used before. For example in the cheat sheet article, the command find /home -mtime -1 allows you to find all files in the given directory (and subdirectories) which have been modified in the last 24 hours. I also realized how important it is to organize your files and directories because when I get a job and work for a large corporation, there will be many files which will be hard to locate without proper organization and structure. Also naming the file in the most specific way possible is also crucial in locating the file location. Another important thing I learned is that if I do not understand a script, I could use the manual page for further explanation of each and every command.
