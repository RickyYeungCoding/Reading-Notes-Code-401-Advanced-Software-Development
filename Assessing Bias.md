# Assessing Bias
I scored a 101 on the assesment, which was surprising since I do realize I have some biases. I scored the lowest on Bias and Identity, because im my mind I believe that every action you do in life creates a butterfly effect which can cause me act in a
biased way, either positive or negative, toward someone else. This is something I need to improve on as Im starting to realize that everyone as a human changes throughout their lives so being bias is being ignorant.
