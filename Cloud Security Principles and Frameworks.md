# Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.
The instance (or virtual machine) abstraction is like renting a computer in the cloud and using its software and operating system. Container abstraction is creating a small, self-contained boxes for your apps. The Function abstraction is It's like a magic box for executing your code whenever needed. The Bare Metal abstraction is renting the entire physical server without pre-installed software. The Full Container abstraction is like renting a container without worrying about the technical details. AWS handles everything, from infrastructure to setup.
# What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?
The control plane is responsible for managing and coordinating all the containers in your system while the data plane is responsible for providing computing capacity needed to run containers.
# Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?
AWS Lambda falls under the Function Abstraction layer and what makes it special is its even driven model, which allows you to trigger a Lamda function upon an event in another AWS service.
