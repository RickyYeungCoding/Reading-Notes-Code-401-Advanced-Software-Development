# Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset
In this video, Carol Dweck talks about having a growth mindset, which she talks about how abilities and intelligence can be developed through hardwork and dedication. She also believes that improvement is possible and that failure is not a permanent condition. This is important because in cybersecurity you will run into a lot of ambigious situations where you will fail, but you will end up learning in the process of finding that solution. She also mentions that people with growth mindsets tend to reach their full potential, I can relate because in my previous expereience I was faced with obstacles that I did not know how to tackle, and I figured out the solution by doing a lot of research and teaching myself which improved by abilities drastically.
